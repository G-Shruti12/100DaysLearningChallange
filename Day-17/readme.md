# Day-17 | Documenting what I learnt
## Topic: Recursion

- Today I learned about **Recursion**, a concept where a function calls itself to solve a smaller version of the same problem.

### ðŸ§  The 3-Step Rule of Recursion:
1. **Assume the function is already made.**
2. **Try to solve a smaller or similar problem** using that function.
3. **Write the base case** â€” the stopping condition that prevents infinite recursion.

âœ¨ Recursion helps in solving problems like factorial, Fibonacci series, and tree traversals elegantly!
