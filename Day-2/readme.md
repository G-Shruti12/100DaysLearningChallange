# Day-2 | Documanting what i learned
- so what is data stucture it is gernally collection of data in stuctured way so that operations can be done easily on it. there are different data stucture for different purposes .
- there are genrally 2 types of data stucture
  - linear data stucture: here data is stored in sequence for example array, stack ,singly linked list
  - Non -linear stucture:data is not stores in a sequence.

# linked list 
- linked list is a linear collection of elements in seqential order. but it is not necessary that element is stored at next index and its size is not fixed so we can't do this thing with linked list
- here we use the singly linked list example 10 20 30 40 50 ....
-    to store this we need pointer but we don't know the size and need a lot of pointer for it so what we do we make a class so when we make  a node 2 variables data and adress of next element is found.
-    here this stucture we make we call it node containing data and *next
-    in js this pointer is a refrance object so we can write this->data cause here this is like another name of object.
-    in linked list we can't go back to prior index after going to next so there comes doubly linked list which contains address of nextelement.
