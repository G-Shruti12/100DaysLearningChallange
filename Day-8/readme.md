# 📘 Day 8 – Documenting What I Learned

## 🧩 Introduction

Today, I learned about **HTML**, which is used to build the **skeleton (structure)** of a webpage.

## 🌐 Difference Between Webpage and Website

* A **website** is made up of multiple **webpages**.
* These webpages can either be:

  * Written **directly using HTML**, or
  * **Generated dynamically** using **JavaScript-induced HTML**.

## 🧠 What is HTML?

**HTML (HyperText Markup Language)** is a **markup language**, not a programming language.
It doesn’t show errors; instead, it **tells the browser how to display** the content.

### 📒 Notebook Analogy

Just like in notebooks we use:

* ⭐ Stars to mark important points
* 📦 Boxes for definitions

In HTML, **tags** serve a similar purpose — they tell the browser what each part of the content represents (heading, paragraph, image, etc.).

### 💡 Additional Notes

* On a webpage, all content is text.
* Some text is **hypertext**, while others are **hyperlinks** — which let us navigate between pages.

## 🧩 Basic HTML Structure

```html
<!DOCTYPE html> <!-- Tells the browser we are using HTML5 -->
<html lang="en"> <!-- 'html' is a tag and 'lang' is an attribute that defines the language -->
<head>  
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body> <!-- Main content of the webpage goes here -->
</body>
</html>
```

## ✨ Additional Concepts I Learned

### 🧾 Lorem Ipsum

* A placeholder (dummy) text used for design and testing purposes.
* Can be quickly inserted using **Emmet** in code editors.

### 📤 Form Tag

* The `action` attribute in a `<form>` is used to **submit data** from one webpage to another.

### 🏷️ Empty vs Non-Empty Tags

* **Empty Tags:** Do not have closing tags or inner content (e.g., `<img>`).
* **Non-Empty Tags:** Have both opening and closing tags with content in between (e.g., `<p> ... </p>`).

## 🧾 Summary

HTML defines how a webpage is **structured and rendered** by the browser.
It is the **foundation** of every website — whether the HTML is **written directly** or **generated through JavaScript**.
