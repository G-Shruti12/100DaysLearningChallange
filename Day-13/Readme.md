A deque (pronounced “deck”, short for double-ended queue) is different from a regular queue in how elements are inserted and deleted.

In a regular queue,
➤ Insertion happens only at the rear (enqueue)
➤ Deletion happens only at the front (dequeue)
→ It follows the FIFO (First In, First Out) principle.

In a deque,
➤ Insertion and deletion can happen at both ends — front and rear.
→ This makes it more flexible than a normal queue.

There are also two common types of deques:

Input-restricted deque: insertion allowed only at one end, deletion from both ends.

Output-restricted deque: deletion allowed only at one end, insertion from both ends.
