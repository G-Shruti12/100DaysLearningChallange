- Today, I learned about Stacks.

- A Stack is like a lottery box or a pouch — the item that goes in last comes out first.

- It follows the LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle — the element inserted at the last is removed first.

- The element inserted first is removed at the end.

-- Unlike arrays, we cannot access elements in between; we can only access or modify the top element of the stack.

## ⚙️ Implementation

- I implemented the basic features of a stack using an array.

- Next, I plan to implement it using a linked list for better flexibility and memory management.
