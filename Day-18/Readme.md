## topic: priority  queue using heap data structure.

- Ever wondered how tasks get managed based on priority - like hospital emergencies or CPU scheduling?
<br>
That's exactly what **Priority Queue** does! we'll build it from scratch today 
- so the basic idea of priority queue is the elements with highest priority are processed first.
   - if priority is same than fifo takes place. elements are also added in by their priority.

- we can also perform it using 
  - linked list,
  - arrays, 
  - heap is most preferrd because it is most efficient
