# 🗓️ Day 24 | Documenting What I Learnt  
## 🧩 Topic: XML in One Shot  

- **XML** stands for **eXtensible Markup Language**. It is mainly used to **store and transport data** in a structured format.  
- Even though **JSON** is more common today, XML is still widely used in industries like **banking**, **enterprise systems**, and in many **file formats** such as `.docx`, `.xlsx`, and `.svg`, which are XML-based.  
- XML provides a **standardized way to represent data**, ensuring that data is read consistently across platforms and applications.  

### 🏷️ Key Features  
- Unlike HTML, XML allows us to **create our own tags**, which are **self-descriptive**, for example:  
  ```xml
  <employee></employee>

- well form xml
   - one thing to note only one root element in xml furrthur it can have child elements
    - we can also give attribute to elements which is meta data
- we can do data validation here :
    - xsd( new and better)
    - dtd(old and have problems)
