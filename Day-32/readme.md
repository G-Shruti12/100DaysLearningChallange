- When data is transferred between a server and a local system, it passes through various layers like CDNs.
   To store or exchange this data, we use structured formats such as JSON, XML, or YAML.
- today json which is quite popular its full form is javascript object notation which is now used in api integration and many parts
- in json everything is written in the form of javascript object that is key value pairs.
